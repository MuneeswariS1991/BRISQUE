# BRISQUE
score = brisque (A) calculates the no-reference image quality score for image A using the Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator (BRISQUE). BRISQUE relies on spatial Natural Scene Statistics (NSS) model of locally normalized luminance coefficients in the spatial domain, as well as the model for pairwise products of these coefficients.brisque compare A to a default model computed from images of natural scenes with similar distortions. A smaller score indicates better perceptual quality. Metric Description; brisque: Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator (BRISQUE). A BRISQUE model is trained on a database of images with known distortions, and BRISQUE is limited to evaluating the quality of images with the same type of distortion.
